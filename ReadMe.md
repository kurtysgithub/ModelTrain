<h1>DCC++ DIY</h1>
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
<p> </p>
This describes my homemade DCC++ model train system, where 6 trains can run at the same time.<p>
The DCC++ signals send through the tracks from the controlunit to the trains are described - as well as the related coding.<p>
A control unit with 6 manual controls have been constructed using an arduino and related hardware.<p>
A decoder for the train is also build using an arduino.
