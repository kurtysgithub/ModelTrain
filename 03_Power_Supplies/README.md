	<p>Two power sources are needed<br/>
	- one +5 Volt supply to feed Arduinos, Track switching circuits, track switches and the Polarity Change circuits.<br/>
	- one +20 to 24 Volt supply to feed the Controlunit powercircuit delivering power and signals through the tracks to the trains.
	</p>
	<p>It is highly recommended to make these supplies SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTED.</p>
	<p>I chose the easy solution and bought 2 Switch Mode Power Supplies - each delivering af few amps with short circuit protection build in. The benefit of this is a power supply that has low loss at the same time - saving power and money.</p>
	<p>For my own comfort I also connected a current and voltage monitor to each supply - which allow me to read the status of the supply.</p>
	<p>TODO - insert curcuit diagram and picture here</p>
