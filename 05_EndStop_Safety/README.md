<h2>EndStop - safety electronics</h2>
<p>I have an endstop railway statin placed high upon a wall below a window. If the train does not stop it will colide with the wall and fall down onto the floor....UPS...I cannot afford that !</p>
<p>In order to protect myself from desaster I feed the last part of the track through some relays. Across the track a ligth transmitter/sensor is placed. When a train passes this sensor the light is interrupted and and arduino switches the relay to turn the trackpower turns off.<br/>
At the same time a buzzer makes a sound to attrack your attention !<br/>
A MANUAL reset is needed when the train has been pushed away from the danger zone.</p>
